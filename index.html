            The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but it has become popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.
            Early AI research in the 1950s explored problem-solving and symbolic methods. In the 1960s, the U.S. Department of Defense became interested in this field and trained computers to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects in the 1970s. It also developed intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa, or Cortana became popular.
            This early work laid the foundation for automation and formal reasoning, which we see in today, computational systems, including decision support systems and intelligent search engines that enhance human capabilities.
            While Hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict AI as human-like robots taking over the world, the current evolution of AI technology is not that dramatic or advanced. Instead, AI has evolved to provide numerous benefits across various industries. Keep reading to discover modern examples of artificial intelligence in healthcare, retail, and more.
